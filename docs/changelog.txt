=============================================================================================================================
26.MAY.07
    ADD: [Project] Build system overhaul (still in progress). game.js now chains together the scripts for the game so that
         1) only one script entry is needed in index.php, and 2) the build system can now read those included scripts from
         game.js and replace game.js with the merged copy - reducing the number of js files to load separately in the
         compressed site. This also works for CSS files, merging in any @import commands. Files that exist only in the source
         code, and not in the compressed output (because of said merging) are prefixed with underscore. Where before, we were
         loading "cards.js", "classes.js" & "game.js" for Blacjax, we are now only loading a single merged "game.js" (in the 
         compressed site)
    ADD: [Blacjax] Used Thomas Fuch's improved shuffle routine
25.MAY.07
    ADD: [Blacjax] Switched to using a sprite sheet for the cards for quicker load times
    FIX: [Blacjax] Empty message on headsup when 8 is put down on same suit, now says "Another Go"
    ADD: [Shared] Upgraded to Scriptaculous 1.7.1_beta3 / Prototype 1.5.1
    FIX: [Shared] "options has no properties" workaround caused by Effect.Parallel having no options
11.APR.07
    FIX: [Shared] All text in the chat box being recognised as URLs
10.APR.07
    ADD: [Shared] Reduced the number of `.style.display="none|block"` in favour of `.hide|show ();`
    FIX: [Blacjax] Empty message on headsup when 8 is put down on same suit
08.APR.07
    FIX: [Project] Had to revert the unicode because of poor support in browsers and on Windows :(
    ADD: [Blacjax] Renamed 'face' to 'discard'
    FIX: [Blacjax] An 8 is not labelled "change suit" if the face card's suit is not actually different
07.APR.07
    FIX: [Shared] Finally got rid of that strange mystery padding above the first chat message
    FIX: [Othello] Clouds not showing in Safari
    FIX: [Othello] Safari board alignment bug
    ADD: [Shared] Changed the game area & chatcol DIVs to absolute positioning, dropping the 45px value that had to be added
         to every `top` value in the code. Now the game area starts at effective `top: 0` making things much simpler
    FIX: [Shared] Niggle. The player info bar now lines up with the top of the textarea in the chatbox on the right
    FIX: [Shared] Fixed window-overflow problem caused by PlayerMe's information bar at the bottom of the screen
    NEW: [Shared] Chatbox now supports *bold*, /italic/, _underline_ markup
06.APR.07
    ADD: [Shared] Emoticon replacement is now a separate function, and ignores html tags
    NEW: [Shared] URLs in the chatbox are turned into hyperlinks
    ADD: [Project] Added tags to the changelog "[Project],[Shared],[Build],[Othello]" etc. and cleaned up everything
    ADD: [Shared] Removed 'barbg.png' by extending 'barme.png' to account for slide up height too
    ADD: [Shared] Split `shared.connect` into `shared.startConnection` and `shared.joinConnection`
    ADD: [Shared] Moved the UI to enter name/join key for title screen "Start/Join Game" buttons to templates in `shared`.
         The games now no longer need a "#page-user" and their own UI to enter name/join-key
05.APR.07
    ADD: [Shared] Moved the custom Scriptaculous header out of 'js/CONFIG.js' into 'js/libs/scriptaculous/scriptaculous.js'
         so that the default version number of Scriptaculous is out of the user configuration (which should be near enough
         independent)
02.APR.07
    FIX: [Build] Unicode ellipsis not displaying in build script
19.MAR.07
    ADD: [Build] Changed file names created by build script
    NEW: [Build] Build script now creates a Jax distribution (just 'jax/')
    ADD: [Shared] Moved 'js/json.js' to 'jax/libs/' as it's directly related to Jax, not Jax Games. This file will be
         obsoleted by Prototype 1.5.1 once it's out and stable
    ADD: [Project] I ï£¿ Unicode. See diff for details
17.MAR.07
    ADD: [Project] Rejiggered the copyright notices to add the website address
13.MAR.07
    FIX: [Othello] Scriptaculous error after the clouds have reached the end of their animation
    NEW: [Shared] Page show/hide events. `shared.showPage` now uses the `game.pages` array and calls the show/hide functions
         there. This is so you can start/stop animation on each page as you switch between them (e.g. title screen)
    FIX: [Shared] BSOD now stays above everything else (z-index:999;)
12.MAR.07
    ADD: [Project] Changed Effect.MoveBy uses (depreciated) to Effect.Move
    ADD: [Shared] Variable in CONFIG.js to enable/disable the BSOD
    FIX: [Shared] BSOD shows filename and line number for thrown errors
11.MAR.07
    FIX: [Build] ZIPs/RARs spun from the build script now extract without the 'release' folder in them
    NEW: [Build] RAR support for the build script. 
    FIX: [Project] Unicode em-dash in Licence.txt
    FIX: [Build] In a monumental bit of stupidity I have realised that the build script's ZIPs of the source have been
         completely useless all this time, joy.
10.MAR.07
    FIX: [Othello] `winner` undefined in `game.win`
    NEW: [Othello] Menu item animation
    ADD: [Othello] Less `updateBoard` calls
    NEW: [Othello] 'flip' animation for pieces. (will need some improvement, but it works for now)
    ADD: Changed Effect.Opacity to Effect.Appear/Fade,toggle where appropriate
    ADD: [Othello] Title logo (It's not very good) and basic menus for now
    FIX: [Build] Build system now keeps file modification times, making syncing with an FTP copy easier
09.MAR.07
    ADD: [Project] Upgraded to Creative Commons 3.0 licence
    FIX: [Build] Updated '_build/headers/boot.js' for Scriptaculous 1.7.0
    FIX: [Blacjax] Hand cursor when mouse over card, but not when in `:hover` state (occurs when flicking between two windows)
    FIX: [Blacjax, Othello] Clicking Resign at the end left the screen blank for the local player
    ADD: [Blacjax, Othello] Changed the game over message to be on the heads-up message instead of the playerStatus
    NEW: [Project] New release on Google Code
    FIX: [Build] '_build/libs/makeboot.js' was incorrectly including 'firebugx.js', preventing the compiled release working
         on browsers without Firebug installed :/
    FIX: [Othello] Error in `game.end`. `winner` is an object not a boolean
    ADD: [Shared] Improved the heads-up to allow a callback function
    ADD: [Shared] The heads-up object has been moved from blacjax to shared so that all games can access it via
         `shared.headsup.show`
08.MAR.07
    ADD: [Shared] Upgraded to Scriptaculous 1.7.0! (fix below has made this possible)
    FIX: [Project] Fixed a lot of jittering in Parallel animations by adding `sync:true`
    ADD: [Project] Lots of housekeeping, reduction and re-factoring all over the codebase
    ADD: [Othello] Added templates there too
    NEW: [Shared] `shared.templates` utilising Prototype's Template class
    ADD: [Shared] Improved the look of the join-key display
    ADD: [Blacjax] Improvements to the heads-up message (`game.setStatus`)
    FIX: [Build] 'boot.js' and '_build/libs/makeboot.js' not loading custom Scriptaculous correctly
07.MAR.07
    NEW: [Blacjax] Message in the middle of the screen declaring the action of the opponent's played card. e.g. "Pickup 5"
    ADD: [Build] Logging in build script
03.FEB.07
    ADD: [Shared] Moved 'Prototype'.js into 'js/libs/scriptaculous' folder
    FIX: [Shared] 'dump_src.js' was HTML-encoding only functions, and not strings
    ADD: [Shared] Changed 'board.js' to be 0-based instead of 1-based because `json` was incorrectly encoding the cells array
         without the first undefined element in each; therefore a board layout would not reconstruct from JSON correctly
21.JAN.07
    NEW: [Build] Build system now zips the source code for easy distribution for those without SVN
    NEW: [Build] Build system stops if any of the steps errors, returning an error code equal to the step that failed
20.JAN.07
    NEW: [Project] I'm really struggling with the direction of this project now, some real help would be appreciated
    NEW: [Build] 'boot.js' uses `config` to dynamically build the list of files to include. the build system now uses
         'makeboot.js' to load 'config.js' and dynamically build the same list, but merge the scripts together into the
         compressed 'boot.js'. This system needs a proper write up and improving, but for now provides the power to share
         config settings between the running browser, and the build system
19.JAN.07
    NEW: [Shared] 'CONFIG.js', configuration script, lets you specify what version of Scriptaculous to use
    FIX: [Shared] `dump()` now ignores the new size function from Prototype. Also no longer uses a parameter for Prototype
         functions in the output. Prototype is detected, and automatically ignored in the output as needed
18.JAN.07
    ADD: [Shared] Updated to Prototype.js v1.5.0 release! http://prototypejs.org
    NEW: [Shared] 'docs/standards.html': some preliminary documentation on coding style used throughout
09.JAN.07
    ADD: [Shared] 'board.js' now includes `<cols>` so you can use CSS/JS to style a vertical column (useful for Quadrop)
08.JAN.07
    ADD: [Build] Build script now downloads 'custom_rhino.jar' if not present so that it doesn't have to be included in SVN
    NEW: [Othello] Some initial title screen graphics, more to come
    ADD: [Quadrop] Four-in-a-Row is now "Quadrop"
07.JAN.07
    NEW: [Shared] 'docs/acknowledgements.txt'
    FIX: [Shared] Improvements to Dump
         + _lots_ of code cleaning
         + Ignore Prototype functions
         + Window height/width arguments
         + Uses a CSS block instead of inline CSS (removed the huge `_dumpStyles` function)
         + Strings are braced by speech marks to make numbers stored as a string / nullstrings obvious
         + No longer pollutes the global namespace with outside functions. all functions are internal
         + Functions are shown in `<pre>` blocks with horizontal scrollbar if needed
         + HTML in functions does not break. this can be massively improved
         + IE/Safari/Opera support is broken, will work on this
06.JAN.07
    NEW: [Shared] Shuns Dump script www.netgrow.com.au/files added. see 'js/libs/dump_src.js'. I'm working on greatly
         improving this script. use `dump(any var);` in the console/Firebug to use
    FIX: [Blacjax] Play Again links staying on screen when starting new game
    FIX: [Blacjax] Card images not displaying
    FIX: [Blacjax] Points not adding when winning
05.JAN.07
    ADD: [Shared] Removed the `onclick` events from the HTML, and moved to 'shared.js'
    ADD: [Shared] Moved `games/othello/game.js:game._.directions` to Board class ('board.js') so that multiple games don't
         need to repeat these vectors
    NEW: [Othello] Black & White piece user icons
    ADD: [Shared] Renamed 'games/images/' to 'games/-' and moved 'games/inc' to 'games/-/inc'. with this name, the images
         folder stands out from the folders containing games, there are no longer two folders not related to games there,
         and "-" will always stay at the top of the list when alphabetically sorted. Also, less letters in the CSS/HTML
         saving a few bytes for what it's worth
    ADD: [Shared] Removed the ability for users to choose icons. User's icons will be according to what game they are playing
         to better remind them of which piece they are, and to simplify the code / speed up starting games. this is blue vs.
         red for the moment until icons have been made for each of the current games
    NEW: [FourInARow] 'games/fourinarow', completely non functional at the moment
    NEW: [Shared] 'docs/todo.txt' to detail main tasks
    FIX: [Shared] Player.wins default was "" not 0
    FIX: [Othello] Play Again not working, `this.start` was in the wrong scope (see `game.end`)
04.JAN.07
    ADD: [Shared] 'shared.js' now uses an object called `shared`, instead of `game`. the `game` object is now game specific,
         in 'game.js'. This is done so there is less confusion over references to `this.xxxx` where `xxxx` is in 'shared.js'
         and not 'game.js', and to allow shadow functions in 'shared.js' to then elevate to 'game.js'. For example,
         disconnect messages can be handled at the shared level, before being passed on to the game, something not (easily)
         possible before
    ADD: [Othello] `game.findBridge` will now only call the callback function on directions that yield a valid move. The
         function no longer needs to be called twice to first check for a valid move in a direction, and then again to
         execute the callback for each cell. This improves speed and LOC
    ADD: [Othello] `playableCellMouseOver/Out` uses new `playableCellMouseHover` function to avoid duplicating the same code,
         bar one function name. Uses Prototype `.invoke` to dynamically call the relevant function
02.JAN.07
    ADD: [Shared] `game.connect` now sets the name/icon in the player info bars so that duplicate code is not needed in
         'games/*/game.js'
01.JAN.07
    FIX: [Othello] As the HTML table is not being recreated every time, the mouse events were not being removed after a click
    NEW: [Othello] Now highlights which cells will be captured when hovering over a playable cell
    NEW: [Project] New year
30.DEC.06
    ADD: [Shared] 'board.js' `Board` class no longer recreates the HTML table every update. This will avoid flicker caused by
         having to load all the piece graphics every update. The class now only updates the html in a cell if it has changed
    NEW: Othello: Piece counts on the sides
    ADD: [Othello] Switched to Black goes first (instead of white), as per official rules
    FIX: [Othello] Properly fixed `preempt` routine. It was not working as previously advertised. The pre-empt also now
         checks for a winner, and if a player is totally wiped off the board
28.DEC.06
    NEW: [Othello] Graphics for board and pieces
    NEW: [Othello] Pre-empts if a player cannot take a go (not tested fully though, and some kind of message will need to be
         displayed on screen to alert the player)
27.DEC.06
    ADD: [Project] Slow week. Added section to 'install.txt' for changing the 'db' folder permissions (Mac OS)
26.DEC.06
    NEW: [Project] 'licence.txt'
25.DEC.06
    NEW: [Project] 'install.txt'. Need Windows & Linux instructions
    ADD: [Build] Improved build system to use Find command so that new JS files in the source can be handled automatically
24.DEC.06
    NEW: [Build] Build system in _build. Uses Dojo's compressor, and Dean Edward's Packer to compress the scripts
22.DEC.06
    FIX: [blacjax] When there was five or more cards on the run they slid the wrong way to make room for the new card
    FIX: [Blacjax] "preempt failed" bug. When you took a penalty, but still had no playable cards
    FIX: [Blacjax] Some overlapping problems
    ADD: [Blacjax] Preempt before checking for win - if the player puts down a 2/BJ as their last card, and the opponent has
         another 2/BJ, then the penalty must be taken. Also if you put down a 2/BJ as last card, and the opponent places a
         Red Jack, the penalty is cancelled; then the winner is decided (can be opponent, if red jack was their last card)
21.DEC.06
    NEW: [Shared] Removed debug object (a wrapper for Firebug), and added Firebug Lite (see 'boot.js')
    NEW: [Shared] Window title is now changed to reflect game status (`game.setTitle`)
    NEW: [Shared] Added `.name` and `.version` constants to 'game.js'. The version info is `debug.info`'d on page load

         put on the discard pile
17.DEC.06
