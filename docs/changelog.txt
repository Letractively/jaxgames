jaxgames changelog | NEW : New feature/code | ADD : Addition/change to existing code | FIX : Bug/problem fixed
=============================================================================================================================
19.MAR.07
    ADD: changed file names created by build script
    NEW: build script now creates a jax distribution (just ‘jax/’)
    NEW: Added prototype.js to ‘jax/libs/’ so that jax can be distributed separately with the appropriate 3rd party libs
    ADD: Cleanup in jax’s PHP files
    ADD: Moved ‘js/json.js’ to ‘jax/libs/’ as it’s directly related to jax, not jaxgames. This file will be obsoleted by
         Prototype 1.5.1 once it’s out and stable
    ADD: I  Unicode. See diff for details
17.MAR.07
    ADD: Rejiggered the copyright notices to add the website address
15.MAR.07
    ADD: jax: additional constructor parameter to specify the interval in seconds
    ADD: Changed the jax server to respond in JSON. the `data` attribute is decoded server side before being sent so that
         only one `json.parse` call needs to be made locally. 
13.MAR.07
    FIX: Othello: Scriptaculous error after the clouds have reached the end of their animation
    NEW: page show/hide events. `shared.showPage` now uses the `game.pages` array and calls the show/hide functions there.
         the reason for this is so you can start/stop animation on each page as you switch between them (e.g. title screen)
    FIX: bsod now stays above everythig else (z-index:999;)
12.MAR.07
    ADD: Changed Effect.MoveBy uses (depreciated) to Effect.Move
    ADD: variable in CONFIG.js to enable/disable the bsod
    FIX: bsod shows filename and line number for thrown errors
11.MAR.07
    FIX: ZIPs/RARs spun from the build script now extract without the ‘release’ folder in them
    NEW: RAR support for the build script. 
    FIX: Unicode em-dash in Licence.txt
    FIX: In a monumental bit of stupidity I have realised that the build script’s ZIPs of the source have been completely
         useless all this time, joy.
10.MAR.07
    FIX: Othello: `winner` undefined in `game.win`
    NEW: Othello: Menu item animation
    ADD: Othello: Less `updateBoard` calls
    NEW: Othello: ‘flip’ animation for pieces. (will need some improvement, but it works for now)
    ADD: Changed Effect.Opacity to Effect.Appear/Fade,toggle where appropriate
    ADD: Othello title logo (It’s not very good) and basic menus for now
    FIX: build_mac.command now keeps file modification times, making syncing with an FTP copy easier
    FIX: bug from below causing the release version to present the db-not-writeable error incorrectly
    ADD: Renamed ‘jax_php’ to ‘jax’. Moved the PHP files into ‘jax/php’. This will provide room for others to contribute
         API-compatible alternative server-side scripts for Jax, such as Ruby or ASP.
09.MAR.07
    ADD: upgraded to Creative Commons 3.0 licence
    FIX: updated _build/headers/boot.js for scriptaculous 1.7.0
    FIX: Blacjax: Hand cursor when mouse over a card, but not when in :hover state (occurs when flicking between two windows)
    FIX: Blacjax, Othello: Clicking Resign at the end left the screen blank for the local player
    ADD: Blacjax, Othello: Changed the game over message to be on the heads-up message instead of the playerStatus
    NEW: New release on Google Code
    FIX: _build/libs/makeboot.js was incorrectly including firebugx.js, preventing the compiled release working on browsers
         without Firebug installed :/
    FIX: error in `game.end`. `winner` is an object not a boolean
    ADD: Improved the heads-up to allow a callback function
    ADD: The heads-up object has been moved from blacjax to shared so that all games can access it via `shared.headsup.show`
08.MAR.07
    ADD: Upgraded to Script.aculo.us 1.7.0! (fix below has made this possible)
    FIX: Fixed a lot of jittering in Parallel animations by adding sync:true
    ADD: Lots of housekeeping, reduction and refactoring all over the codebase
    ADD: Othello: added templates there too
    NEW: `shared.templates` utilising Prototype’s Template class
    ADD: Shared: Improved the look of the join-key display
    ADD: Blacjax: Improvements to the heads-up message (game.setStatus)
    FIX: boot.js and _build/libs/makeboot.js not loading custom scriptaculous correctly
07.MAR.07
    NEW: Blacjax: Message in the middle of the screen declaring the action of the opponent’s played card. e.g. “Pickup 5”
    ADD: Logging in build script
03.FEB.07
    ADD: Moved prototype.js into scriptaculous folder
    FIX: dump_src.js was html encoding only functions, and not strings
    ADD: Changed board.js to be 0-based instead of 1-based because json was incorrectly encoding the cells array without the
         first undefined element in each; therefore a board layout would not reconstruct from json correctly.
21.JAN.07
    NEW: Build system now zips the source code for easy distribution for those without SVN
    NEW: Build system stops if any of the steps errors, returning an error code equal to the step that failed
20.JAN.07
    NEW: I’m really struggling with the direction of this project now, some real help would be appreciated
    NEW: boot.js uses config to dynamically build the list of files to include. the build system now uses makeboot.js to load
         config.js and dynamically build the same list, but merge the scripts together into the compressed boot.js. This 
         system needs a proper write up and improving, but for now provides the power to share config settings between the
         running browser, and the build system
19.JAN.07
    NEW: CONFIG.js, configuration script, lets you specify what version of Scriptaculous to use
    FIX: dump() now ignores the new size function from Prototype. Also no longer uses a parameter to include Prototype
         functions in the output. Prototype is detected, and automatically ignored in the output as needed
18.JAN.07
    ADD: Updated to Prototype.js v1.5.0 release! http://prototypejs.org
    NEW: /docs/standards.html: some preliminary documentation on coding style used throughout
09.JAN.07
    ADD: board.js now includes <cols> so you can use CSS/JS to style a vertical column (useful for Quadrop)
08.JAN.07
    ADD: Build script now downloads custom_rhino.jar if not present so that it doesn’t have to be included in our SVN
    NEW: Some initial title screen graphics for Othello, more to come
    ADD: Four-in-a-Row is now “Quadrop”
07.JAN.07
    NEW: /docs/acknowledgements.txt
    FIX: Improvements to Dump
         + _lots_ of code cleaning
         + ignore Prototype functions
         + window height/width arguments
         + uses a CSS block instead of inline CSS (removed the huge _dumpStyles function)
         + strings are braced by speech marks to make numbers stored as a string / nullstrings obvious
         + no longer pollutes the global namespace with outside functions. all functions are internal
         + functions are shown in <pre> blocks with horizontal scrollbar if needed
         + html in functions does not break. this can be massively improved
         + IE/Safari/Opera support is broken, will work on this
06.JAN.07
    NEW: Shuns Dump script www.netgrow.com.au/files added. see /js/libs/dump_src.js. I’m working on greatly improving this
         script. use dump(any var); in the console/firebug to use
    FIX: Blacjax: Play Again links staying on screen when starting new game
    FIX: Card images not displaying in blacjax
    FIX: Points not adding when winning in blacjax
05.JAN.07
    ADD: removed the onclick events from the HTML, and moved to shared.js
    ADD: moved /games/othello/game.js:game._.directions to Board class (board.js) so that multiple games don’t need to
         repeat these vectors
    NEW: Othello uses Black & White piece user icons
    ADD: Renamed /games/images/ to /games/- and moved games/inc to /games/-/inc. with this name, the images folder stands
         out from the folders containing games, there are no longer two folders not related to games there, and "-" will
         always stay at the top of the list when alphabetically sorted. Also, less letters in the CSS/HTML saving a few bytes
         for what it’s worth
    ADD: removed the ability for users to choose icons. user’s icons will be according to what game they are playing to
         better remind them of which piece they are, and to simplify the code / speed up starting games. this is blue vs.
         red for the moment until icons have been made for each of the current games
    ADD: Some CSS cleaning and reorganisation
    NEW: /games/fourinarow, completely non functional at the moment
    NEW: /docs/todo.txt to detail main tasks
    FIX: Player.wins default was "" not 0
    FIX: Play Again not working on othello, this.start was in the wrong scope (see game.end)
04.JAN.07
    ADD: shared.js now uses an object called shared, instead of game. the game object is now game specific, in game.js
         this is done so there is less confusion over references to this.xxxx where xxxx is in shared.js and not game.js,
         and to allow shadow functions in shared.js to then elevate to game.js. For example, disconnect messages can be
         handled at the shared level, before being passed on to the game, something not (easily) possible before
    ADD: game.findBridge will now only call the callback function on directions that yield a valid move. The function no
         longer needs to be called twice to first check for a valid move in a direction, and then again to execute the 
         callback for each cell. This improves speed and LOC
    ADD: playableCellMouseOver/Out uses new playableCellMouseHover function to avoid duplicating the same code, bar one
         function name. Uses Prototype .invoke to dynamically call the relevant function
02.JAN.07
    NEW: docs folder in jax_php + licence.txt. added so that Jax could be distributed separately
    ADD: Changed the default location of response.php in jax.js from response.php to jax_php/response.php to reflect the new
         folder layout
    ADD: moved inc folder in jax_php to games/inc as it contained some PHP includes that are specific to JaxGames. the
         jax_php folder is meant to be solely for jax as this will form the basis of a re-distributable package for Jax.
    ADD: changed /server folder to /jax_php. jax.js (and the PHP backend) will eventually become a separate, reusable script
         and distributed on the site by itself as well as with JaxGames.
    NEW: added CONFIG.php so that users can change the database path without having to edit JaxPHP directly.
    ADD: game.connect now sets the name/icon in the player info bars so that duplicate code is not needed in games/*/game.js
01.JAN.07
    FIX: Othello: as the html table is not being recreated every time, the mouse events were not being removed after a click
    NEW: Othello now highlights which cells will be captured when hovering over a playable cell
    NEW: year
30.DEC.06
    ADD: board.js Board class no longer recreates the HTML table every update. This will avoid flicker caused by having to
         load all the piece graphics every update. The class now only updates the html in a cell if it has changed
    NEW: Othello: Piece counts on the sides
    ADD: Othello: Switched to Black goes first (instead of white), as per official rules.
    FIX: Properly fixed Othello’s preempt routine. It was not working as previously advertised. The preempt also now checks
         for a winner, and if a player is totally wiped off the board
28.DEC.06
    NEW: Graphics for Othello: board and pieces
    NEW: Othello preempts if a player cannot take a go (not tested fully though, and some kind of message will need to be
         displayed on screen to alert the player)
27.DEC.06
    ADD: Changed the default location of response.php in Jax from server/response.php to just response.php to be more
         generic and not force people to use a /server folder. It is more likely that response.php may just be put in webroot
         or the same folder as the calling javascript
    ADD: Slow week. Added section to install.txt for changing the db folder permissions (Mac OS)
26.DEC.06
    NEW: licence.txt
25.DEC.06
    NEW: install.txt. Need Windows & Linux instructions
    ADD: improved build system to use Find command so that new JS files in the source can be handled automatically
24.DEC.06
    NEW: Build system in _build. Uses Dojo’s compressor, and Dean Edward’s Packer to compress the scripts
22.DEC.06
    FIX: when there was five or more cards on the run they slid the wrong way to make room for the new card
    FIX: "preempt failed" bug. When you took a penalty, but still had no playable cards
    FIX: Some overlapping problems
    ADD: Preempt before checking for win - if the player puts down a 2/BJ as their last card, and the opponent has another
         2/BJ, then the penalty must be taken. Also if you put down a 2/BJ as last card, and the opponent places a Red Jack,
         the penalty is cancelled; then the winner is decided (can be opponent, if red jack was their last card)
21.DEC.06
    NEW: removed debug object (a wrapper for Firebug), and added Firebug Lite (see boot.js)
    NEW: window title is now changed to reflect game status (game.setTitle)
    NEW: Added .name and .version constants to game.js. The version info is `debug.info`’d on page load
20.DEC.06
    NEW: This new changelog in the SVN
    NEW: Created Google Code project and uploaded code to SVN
19.DEC.06
    NEW: use Insertion methods instead of .innerHTML to put cards into the hand/run to reduce flicker. the .display methods
         have been removed from player*.hand and game.run! cards are now persistent up until being put on the discard
17.DEC.06
    FIX: “O_o” regex broken, the . was being treated as any character, and not just .
    FIX: if typing in the chatbox when starting a new game, the <chat here> appears
16.DEC.06
    FIX: >:) not working, being incorrectly identified as :) first
    NEW: queue cards clicks from the opponent to avoid bugs when two clicks occur at the same time
15.DEC.06
    NEW: Created Boot.js to bootstrap all shared libraries - this can then be replaced with a compressed, merged version of
         said libraries in the distribution version
    NEW: Points tracking between games 
    NEW: Started Othello 
05.DEC.06
    NEW: Win tracking between games 
    NEW: Animation for new chat messages 
30.NOV.06
    NEW: Emoticon panel in and working 
28.NOV.06
    FIX: When the run was filed back onto the deck, the face card leaked out, causing the deck to go eventually empty
    FIX: Both users clicking Play Again at the same time caused the game to fail 
    NEW: The run now compacts the cards in it to fit in more than 4 cards 
    ADD: Improved the hand card spacing so that the hand is always the same width with 7 or more cards 
    ADD: Improved the card graphics by optimising to 8-bit PNGs. From 247KB to 151KB 
    NEW: Timestamps to chatlog 
26.NOV.06
    NEW: game.setPlayerStatus slides the player panel up at the bottom to show a message instead 
    NEW: tooltips to action cards 
    ADD: 8s now do not work as a global wildcard, improving the gameplay a little 
    ADD: switched to using CSS classes for card hover effects 
    NEW: Play Again after game over 
23.NOV.06
    NEW: pre-empt routine to take penalties or cards without having to wait for AJAX. In fact, there is no specific player
         switch point!! 
    FIX: when a penalty is taken, it should be your go, and not theirs 
20.NOV.06
    ADD: changed SetGameStatus to SetStatus and SetSystemStatus for messages for all games, and messages for the particular
         game you’re playing 
17.NOV.06
    NEW: disconnect function to jax, and disconnect signal when a user closes the window 
15.NOV.06
    FIX: more refactoring, removed jax.ajax and flattened into just jax 
    NEW: now gets multiple messages from the queue in one go to save a three second wait between each 
14.NOV.06
    FIX: finally moved jax into a generic class. the player name is sent as custom data. jax can now be used for any website
         wanting to set up a 1-1 connection between people. 
13.NOV.06
    ADD: moved jax into a class to get rid of jax.ajax.init 
    ADD: switched to using JSON instead of PHP_Serializer 
    FIX: “<chat here>” not disappearing when losing focus 
12.NOV.06
    NEW: created `game` object in global.js, and moved the chatbox into there. 
    ADD: modified jax.js to not include jaxgames specific code, still more to do 
11.NOV.06
    NEW: Started this log. Very late in the game, as jax has already been in development for many months
