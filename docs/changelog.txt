NEW : New feature/code | ADD : Addition/Change to existing code | FIX : Bug/problem fixed
=============================================================================================================================
02.DEC.07
    ADD: moved inc folder in jax_php to games/inc as it contained some PHP includes that are specific to JaxGames. the
         jax_php folder is meant to be solely for jax as this will form the basis of a re-distributable package for Jax.
    ADD: changed /server folder to /jax_php. jax.js (and the PHP backend) will eventually become a separate, reusable script
         and distributed on the site by itself as well as with JaxGames.
    NEW: added CONFIG.php so that users can change the database path without having to edit JaxPHP directly.
    ADD: game.connect now sets the name/icon in the player info bars so that duplicate code is not needed in games/*/game.js
01.DEC.07
    FIX: Othello: as the html table is not being recreated every time, the mouse events were not being removed after a click
    NEW: Othello now highlights which cells will be captured when hovering over a playable cell
    NEW: year
30.DEC.06
    ADD: board.js Board class no longer recreates the HTML table every update. This will avoid flicker caused by having to
         load all the piece graphics every update. The class now only updates the html in a cell if it has changed
    NEW: Othello: Piece counts on the sides
    ADD: Othello: Switched to Black goes first (instead of white), as per official rules.
    FIX: Properly fixed Othello's preempt routine. It was not working as previously advertised. The preempt also now checks
         for a winner, and if a player is totally wiped off the board
28.DEC.06
    NEW: Graphics for Othello: board and pieces
    NEW: Othello preempts if a player cannot take a go (not tested fully though, and some kind of message will need to be
         displayed on screen to alert the player)
27.DEC.06
    ADD: Changed the default location of response.php in Jax from server/response.php to just response.php to be more
         generic and not force people to use a /server folder. It is more likely that response.php may just be put in webroot
         or the same folder as the calling javascript
    ADD: Slow week. Added section to install.txt for changing the db folder permissions (Mac OS)
26.DEC.06
    NEW: licence.txt
25.DEC.06
    NEW: install.txt. Need Windows & Linux instructions
    ADD: improved build system to use Find command so that new JS files in the source can be handled automatically
24.DEC.06
    NEW: Build system in _build. Uses Dojo's compressor, and Dean Edward's Packer to compress the scripts
22.DEC.06
    FIX: when there was five or more cards on the run they slid the wrong way to make room for the new card
    FIX: "preempt failed" bug. When you took a penalty, but still had no playable cards
    FIX: Some overlapping problems
    ADD: Preempt before checking for win - if the player puts down a 2/BJ as their last card, and the opponent has another
         2/BJ, then the penalty must be taken. Also if you put down a 2/BJ as last card, and the opponent places a Red Jack,
         the penalty is cancelled; then the winner is decided (can be opponent, if red jack was their last card)
21.DEC.06
    NEW: removed debug object (a wrapper for Firebug), and added Firebug Lite (see boot.js)
    NEW: window title is now changed to reflect game status (game.setTitle)
    NEW: Added .name and .version constants to game.js. The version info is debug.info'd on page load
20.DEC.06
    NEW: This new changelog in the SVN
    NEW: Created Google Code project and uploaded code to SVN
19.DEC.06
    NEW: use Insertion methods instead of .innerHTML to put cards into the hand/run to reduce flicker. the .display methods
         have been removed from player*.hand and game.run! cards are now persistent up until being put on the discard
17.DEC.06
    FIX: 'O_o' regex broken, the . was being treated as any character, and not just .
    FIX: if typing in the chatbox when starting a new game, the <chat here> appears
16.DEC.06
    FIX: >:) not working, being incorectly identified as :) first
    NEW: queue cards clicks from the opponent to avoid bugs when two clicks occur at the same time
15.DEC.06
    NEW: Created Boot.js to bootstrap all shared libraries - this can then be replaced with a compressed, merged version of
         said libraries in the distribution version
    NEW: Points tracking between games 
    NEW: Started Othello 
05.DEC.06
    NEW: Win tracking between games

30.NOV.06
    NEW: Emoticon panel in and working 
28.NOV.06
    FIX: When the run was filed back onto the deck, the face card leaked out, causing the deck to go eventually empty
    FIX: Both users clicking Play Again at the same time caused the game to fail 
    NEW: The run now compacts the cards in it to fit in more than 4 cards 
    ADD: Improved the hand card spacing so that the hand is always the same width with 7 or more cards 
    ADD: Improved the card graphics by optimizing to 8-bit PNGs. From 247KB to 151KB 
    NEW: Timestamps to chatlog 
26.NOV.06
    NEW: game.setPlayerStatus slides the player panel up at the bottom to show a message instead 
    NEW: tooltips to action cards 
    ADD: 8's now do not work as a global wildcard, improving the gameplay a little 
    ADD: switched to using CSS classes for card hover effects 
    NEW: Play Again after game over 
23.NOV.06
    NEW: pre-empt routine to take penalties or cards without having to wait for AJAX. In fact, there is no specific player
         switch point!! 
    FIX: when a penalty is taken, it should be your go, and not theirs 
20.NOV.06
    ADD: changed SetGameStatus to SetStatus and SetSystemStatus for messages for all games, and messages for the particular
         game you're playing 
17.NOV.06
    NEW: disconnect function to jax, and disconnect signal when a user closes the window 
15.NOV.06
    FIX: more refactoring, removed jax.ajax and flattened into just jax 
    NEW: now gets multiple messages from the queue in one go to save a three second wait between each 
14.NOV.06
    FIX: finally moved jax into a generic class. the player name is sent as custom data. jax can now be used for any website
         wanting to set up a 1-1 connection between people. 
13.NOV.06
    ADD: moved jax into a class to get rid of jax.ajax.init 
    ADD: switched to using JSON instead of PHP_Serializer 
    FIX: '<chat here>' not disappearing when losing focus 
12.NOV.06
    NEW: created 'game' object in global.js, and moved the chatbox into there. 
    ADD: modified jax.js to not include jaxgames specific code, still more to do 
11.NOV.06
