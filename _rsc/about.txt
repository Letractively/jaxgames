Not all of us can afford Adobe Photoshop, nor are thieves. If you can't open these image files - now you know how it feels
for us. If you didn't pay for your copy of Photoshop, consider purchasing Paint Shop Pro; it's fully featured and well
priced. If you did pay for your copy of Photoshop, good on you; I've no complaints there, CS3 on Mac looks super sweet.
