   type   : card game
   desc   : an implementation of BlackJack, popular in Europe & the UK, known as 'Crazy 8's' in America
            this version uses a ruleset common in the UK, with slight moderations to best suit online play

rules of play:
--------------
 + each player starts with 7 cards, and wins by discarding all their cards
 + there is a deck that cards are drawn from, and discard pile that is face up.
 + players take turns to discard a card of theirs, by matching suit or rank with the last card put down face up
 + if you have no cards that can be discarded, you must pickup a card from the deck, and give up your turn
 + certain cards have special powers
   - an Ace allows you to place another card, as long as it is of the same suit/rank as the Ace
   - an 8 allows you to 'change suit', you can place an 8 on to any card, then place another card that matches the new suit
   - you can put down a Joker without having to match the face up card, and then you can put anything on top of it
   - a 2 sets up a penalty of 2 cards. a Black Jack is a penalty of 5 cards
     > your opponent can respond by placing down another 2/Black Jack, which adds to the penalty and turns it against you
       (players can continue to reply with 2s and Black Jacks as long as they have them in their hands)
     > a Red Jack can be used to cancel out the penalty against you
     > if you cannot put down a 2, Black Jack, or Red Jack then you must take the number of penalty cards from the deck
     > after a penalty is taken, that player may then place cards
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- */

var playerMe   = new Player ("game-nearhand", true),  //the player on this computer
    playerThem = new Player ("game-farhand", false)   //the opponent is always the opposite player from either end

                   it was very slow. the opponent would have to wait for your animation to finish before switching players.
                   secondly, if you could not place a card and had to draw one instead, the opponent would have to wait until
                   you had drawn the card before they could be known aware of it. in the situation where neither player
                   could draw a card several times in a row, there would be a massive wait as the game switched from player
                   to player only after each card was drawn
                *//*
                   to speed the gameplay up a lot, a signal is sent to the opponent as soon as you click on a card. each 
                   player's computer will then run this function to determine the outcome of the chosen card - being:
                   + 1.  you / they placed a combo card (Eight, Ace or Joker), and will go again
                   + 2a. you / they have no playable cards, draw a card
                   + 2b. there is a penalty, you / they have no playable cards, take the penalty
                   + 3.  you / they played a valid card, now other person's go
                *//*
                   in the case of 2a, or 2b, the function will call itself again, but assessing the opposite player. this 
                   means that when neither player has a playable card, several times in a row, cards are automatically drawn
                   without having to wait for the opposite player's computer to tell you so
                *//*
                   there are some complex rules about the last card put down (to win the game)
                   
                   + if you put down a Black Jack or a Two as your last card, play switches to the opponent,
                     > if they put down a Red Jack, the penalty is cancelled
                       + if that was their last card, they win, otherwise you win
                     > if they put down a Black Jack or Two you must take the penalty and continue playing
                       + if that was their last card, they win
                     > if they have no Red/Black Jack or Two then they take the penalty and you still win
                   + if you put down a Joker, Ace or Eight as your last card you must take another card (as these
                     cards must always be followed up by placing another card, or taking when no cards are playable)
