Think MSN one on one IM games; but without MSN, without registration, without Flash or Java plugins, without ads, without
annoyances. Just one-on-one with your friends in various games, on any operating system, any common webbrowser, any time.

Jax Games uses 'jax', a script to allow player-to-player communication via AJAX and PHP. The upshot of this, is that just
about any turn-based game you would like can be implemented using the simple API to connect the two players together and then
send messages from computer to computer.

Jax Games aims to recreate the fun friend vs. friend games played over MSN Messenger using open source javascript. Jax Games
specifically does not pit you against some random person on the net and does not have a lobby or other such things. Jax is
aimed squarely at playing a game with a specific, chosen person (as over IM). Few, if any gaming websites cater for this.

Jax does this by giving the player a 'join key' when they start a game, which they can then IM/e-mail/FedEx to their friend,
who uses the key to join the game. Whilst you could have a lobby system and play against strangers; I don't want to play with
asshats - the rest of the Internet will happily cater for them. Jax focuses solely on the friend vs. friend experience.

Notes about the Code:
---------------------
* Written in TextMate on Mac OS X  <http://macromates.com/>
* Code is 125 chars wide, tabs at 8, as spaces. Why 125/8? When you View Source in Firefox, 125/8 is the sizes used to
  display the code (1024x768). Using these sizes makes for good space, promotes less indenting, and views equally in Firefox.
  If you don't like this convention, get used to it. I spent almost a year on/off getting this far, it works.
