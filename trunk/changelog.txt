27.DEC.06
    ADD: Slow week. Added section to install.txt for changing the db folder permissions
26.DEC.06
    NEW: licence.txt
25.DEC.06
    NEW: install.txt. Need Windows & Linux instructions
    ADD: improved build system to use Find command so that new JS files in the source can be handled automatically

22.DEC.06
    FIX: when there was five or more cards on the run they slid the wrong way to make room for the new card
    FIX: "preempt failed" bug. When you took a penalty, but still had no playable cards
    FIX: Some overlapping problems
    ADD: Preempt before checking for win - if the player puts down a 2/BJ as their last card, and the opponent has another
         2/BJ, then the penalty must be taken. Also if you put down a 2/BJ as last card, and the opponent places a Red Jack,
         the penalty is cancelled; then the winner is decided (can be opponent, if red jack was their last card)

    FIX: when a penalty is taken, it should be your go, and not theirs 
20.NOV.06
    ADD: changed SetGameStatus to SetStatus and SetSystemStatus for messages for all games, and messages for the particular
