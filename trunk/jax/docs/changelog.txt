Jax Changelog | NEW : New feature/code | ADD : Addition/change to existing code | FIX : Bug/problem fixed
=============================================================================================================================
25.AUG.07
    BUG: Not disconnecting on window close
    NEW: Connection context to prevent users joining the wrong game in Jax Games
    ADD: Upgraded to Prototype 1.5.1.1
25.MAY.07
    ADD: Depreciated "json.js" in favour of built in JSON parsing in Prototype 1.5.1
    ADD: Upgraded to Prototype 1.5.1
06.APR.07
    NEW: 'jax/docs/changelog.txt'
05.APR.07
    NEW: 'jax/docs/todo.txt' and 'acknowledgements.js'
02.APR.07
    FIX: Syntax typos in the PHP files broke the backend
19.MAR.07
    NEW: Added prototype.js to 'jax/libs/' so that Jax can be distributed separately with the appropriate 3rd-party libs
    ADD: Cleanup in Jax's PHP files
    ADD: I ï£¿ Unicode. See diff for details
17.MAR.07
    ADD: Rejiggered the copyright notices to add the website address
15.MAR.07
    ADD: Jax: Additional constructor parameter to specify the interval in seconds
    ADD: Changed the Jax server to respond in JSON. the `data` attribute is decoded server side before being sent so that
         only one `json.parse` call needs to be made locally
10.MAR.07
    ADD: Renamed 'jax_php' to 'jax'. Moved the PHP files into 'jax/php'. This will provide room for others to contribute
         API-compatible alternative server-side scripts for Jax, such as Ruby or ASP
09.MAR.07
    ADD: Upgraded to Creative Commons 3.0 licence
02.JAN.07
    NEW: 'docs' folder in 'jax_php' + 'licence.txt' added so that Jax could be distributed separately
    ADD: Changed the default location of 'response.php' in 'jax.js' from 'response.php' to 'jax_php/response.php' to reflect
         the new folder layout
    ADD: moved 'inc' folder in 'jax_php' to 'games/inc' as it contained some PHP includes that are specific to Jax Games. the
         'jax_php' folder is meant to be solely for Jax as this will form the basis of a re-distributable package for Jax.
    ADD: changed 'server' folder to 'jax_php'. 'jax.js' (and the PHP backend) will eventually become a separate, reusable
         script and distributed on the site by itself as well as with Jax Games
    NEW: added 'CONFIG.php' so that users can change the database path without having to edit JaxPHP directly
27.DEC.06
    ADD: Changed the default location of 'response.php' in Jax from 'server/response.php' to just 'response.php' to be more
         generic and not force people to use a 'server' folder. It is more likely that 'response.php' may just be put in
         webroot or the same folder as the calling javascript
26.DEC.06
    NEW: 'licence.txt'
17.NOV.06
    NEW: Disconnect function to Jax, and disconnect signal when a user closes the window 
15.NOV.06
    FIX: More re-factoring, removed `jax.ajax` and flattened into just `jax` 
    NEW: Now gets multiple messages from the queue in one go to save a three second wait between each 
14.NOV.06
    FIX: Finally moved Jax into a generic class. The player name is sent as custom data. Jax can now be used for any website
         wanting to set up a 1-1 connection between people
13.NOV.06
    ADD: Moved Jax into a class to get rid of `jax.ajax.init`
    ADD: Switched to using JSON instead of PHP_Serializer
12.NOV.06
    ADD: Modified 'jax.js' to not include Jax Games specific code, still more to do
